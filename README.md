# krepo

`krepo` is a maven repository server, built with Kotlin Native, it supports `linux amd64` only,
15MB ~ 20MB was used after running for 12h.

# Features

1. Low memory usage
2. High performance
3. Support mirror other repositories

# Build and deploy backend

NOTE: If you want to use it quickly just download the executable binary file in the releases.

## Build for linux amd64

```shell
$ ./gradlew replaceDef generateResources linkReleaseExecutableLinuxX64
```
This might take a long time to build the binary file

## Deploy

Just run the executable file.

## Configure backend

Open the `config.json` change the `frontend` value to your own frontend url.
(This setting is only for `/listing` route to redirect the user to the frontend to list repository content)

## Build and deploy frontend

NOTE: Frontend is optional, without frontend backend can also work

Before you build the frontend please modify the config.json at `kmvn-frontend/src/jsMain/resources/config.json`
and change the backend url to your own backend address.

```shell
$ ./gradlew jsBrowserDistribution
```

Then you can find the static files at `kmvn-frontend/build/dist/js/productionExecutable`

Deploy to vercel is recommended, See [.github/workflows/deploy-to-vercel.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-to-vercel.yml)
